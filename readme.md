#BAMAZON

**This is an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills i've learned this week. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.** 

**What can it do?**

`node bamazonCustomer.js`

This will display the information stored in the database and begin your order.

**Ordering something**

Ordering something is as easy as choosing the Item ID that you want.

**Completing the order**

Once you have chosen the item you want enter the quantity you need and press enter. The database will dynamically update the quantities based on how many you ordered.

If you try and order too many of something you will get an error let you know that there isnt enough stock to complete the order.
